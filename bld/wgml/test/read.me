The gml files in this directory are a testbed used to try out some functionality.
They are not ment to produce good looking output.

In the future they may serve for producing comparison files between wgml 4.0 and the new WGML.

tsys06.gml      lists all system variables of form SYSx, x = 1 to 6 letters
                runtime is very long
sysvar.gml      result of tsys06.gml run(s)
tcwli.gml       testfile for .li
tcwpe.gml       testfile for .pe
tcwti.gml       testfile for .ti
thpxsf.gml      testfile for :HPx and :SF tags
tlayfull.gml    testfile for :layout tags (only for new wgml)
tlayout.gml     testfile for :layout tags
tlayno.gml      testfile short without :layout tags
cwcofoju.gml    testfile for .co .fo .ju
tsimpin.gml     included from tsimp00.gml, tsimp01.gml, ... for testing different layouts
tsimpNN.gml     masterfile(s) for different layouts  NN = 00 to ??
tsimpNNi.gml    Layout specification for tsimpNN.gml
ts.gml          .ty for several variables (included from other files)

This file is intended to be used to compare horizontal positioning in wgml 4.0
and the new WGML:

ocdoc1.gml      based on outcheck output, except for reduced sub/sup tests

This file is intended to show what the new WGML can do which wgml 4.0 can not:

ocdoc2.gml      based on outcheck output, including the full sub/sup tests
